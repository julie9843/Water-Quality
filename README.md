# Water-Quality
WORK IN PROGRESS

Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions. 



The dataset used was acquired at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability?select=water_potability.csv), and the csv file can be found [here](https://github.com/julie9843/Water-Quality/blob/main/water_potability.csv).
